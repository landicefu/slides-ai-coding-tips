We should talk to Anthropic sales about the rate limit. | One thing I donâ€™t like is itâ€™s commit based, so the flow alway ends with a commit, but of course you can rebase and squash. |

## Some tips before the demo

- Write documents before writing code
    - This is a very very effective way to work with agentic coding tools
        - Make the context of the project extra clear for the agent for every new chat session
        - Split context into different topics with correct size and focus, so you can tag (mention) the needed context for the task you are going to ask the tool to work on
        - Let the agent know what architectures, tools and dependencies to use
    - You can describe about the project and ask the coding tool to add the documents which makes this extremely easy
    - Iterate on your prompt and document to make it work better and better
- Our experience on software engineering is still very useful. When you don't need to focus too much on the detailed or tedious implementation, you can and you should spend more time on.
    - Documentation
    - What tools to use
    - Architecture and usability design
    - Extensibility
    - Code review
- When the tool seems stupid and keep failing on the tasks
    - Don't expect the AI tool to produce perfect code on the first try. Instead, use an iterative approach.
    - Try using a divide-and-conquer approach to create or modify elements effectively.
        - Commit the successful part and reset the bad part and then iterate
    - Create a new conversation to get rid of some bad context built in current conversation
- Create a folder for agents to write scripts to understand some context
    - For example, what is the existing database structure right now.
    - Normally, I would suggest to add the folder to `.gitignore`, but WindSurf and Cline is designed not to read something got git-ignored.
- Give it detailed enough instructions to make them work better
- For mobile developers
    - Although, there might be plugins and integrations on VS Code or popular IDEs for your platform. It doesnâ€™t seem possible we completely move away from Xcode and Android Studio. Duo IDE  works pretty well for me
- Use them for things other than code
    - Mermaid graphs and charts

## Demonstration

### Cline

please do not try it while I am demonstrating to avoid the rate-limit problem

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

The latest version of Cline has an issue that cause the terminal output not visible for the agent sometimes. You can easily install the previous version of a Plugin in VS Code. In this demo I am using v3.1.6 which doesnâ€™t have the problem yet. However, this version doesnâ€™t have plan mode yet.

Task 1: A web minesweeper game starting from an empty folder

- Steps
    - Add document
    - Complete the basic implementation
    - Add dark mode
    - Change text colors

Task 2: Review a PR from PicCollage Android repository

```
Please help to review one PR from this repository for me.
Use `gh pr` command with `view`, `diff` to get the details and changes.
If you think reading the other part of the codebase is helpful, please just read them from the local files. However, please try not to checkout to another branch. If you have to do checkout, please let me know first. Please do not submit the review result. Just summarize it and list the comments if you have any.

This is the id of the PR: 
```

### WindSurf

- Task: Port a shader from GPUImage to KraftShade (example - `GPUImageSwirlFilter`)
- Useful shortcuts
    - cmd + . â‡’ Toggle write/chat mode
    - cmd + L â‡’ WindSurf panel
    - cmd + shift + L â‡’ Create new conversation
- Steps
    - Create the shader based on KraftShade implementations. Expand to see my prompt.
        
        ```
        Please help port the following shader to KraftShader. Follow the implementation patterns of other KraftShader classes. There are several base KraftShader types available - please check similar shader implementations before modifying the code.
        
        Format guidelines:
        
        - Place shader String constants outside the class body in the same file to maintain a cleaner class structure, as done in other KraftShaders
        - Avoid using location attributes. Instead, use GlUniformDelegate by following existing shader implementations. Do not make assumptions about GlUniformDelegate constructor parameters
        - Maintain the exact shader code unless technically impossible. If changes are necessary, provide clear explanations for the modifications
        - After creating the KraftShader, verify that the GLSL code matches exactly
        
        After porting, please:
        
        - Add test setup to KraftShadeEffectViewTestWindow.kt
        - Update [README.md](http://README.md) by moving the implemented shader from the "Coming Soon" section and marking it as completed
        
        Here is the code from the GPUImage library:
        ```
        ...
        ```
        ```
        
    - Fix things that doesnâ€™t work

- Task 1: Write a unit test for the logic for setting `slot_scrap` feature flag
    - Steps
        - Write the descriptions for the test cases first
        - Let the AI read the descriptions and complete the unit tests
    - Follow Up (try following Test-Driven Design)
        - Try to clean the method in reverse
        - Let the AI read the completed test cases and re-implement the method
- Task 2: Add new option `face` to `preferred_section` in `replace_placeholder` instruction
    - Steps
        - Open up composer
        - Mention the context/scope (`collage` folder) and the description of the changes
        - Submit and review the changes (updated files / new files)
        - Keep iterating the result by talking to AI
        - Once youâ€™re happy with the result, click `Accept`
